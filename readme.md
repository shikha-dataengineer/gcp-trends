🚀 End-to-End Data Engineering Project showcasing how to fetch, clean, process, and analyze Google Trends data with PySpark in a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment.

This project demonstrates data ingestion, transformation, and storage pipelines — key concepts for real-world Data Engineering roles.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python (PySpark, Pandas)

Big Data: Apache Spark

Cloud: Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery)

Libraries: Pytrends, Pandas, PySpark

⚙️ Architecture
Ingestion → Pull live Google Trends data (e.g., AI, Electric Cars, Climate Change) using Pytrends

Transformation → Clean NaN values, format schema, enrich with keyword column

Processing → Convert to Spark DataFrame for scalable processing

Storage → Save data to CSV (or BigQuery in production)

Analytics → Query trends for insights & visualization
